	    <h1>Control your server using Whatsapp</h1>
	  

	  <p>I still haven't found a decent command line app for Android/iPhone. I really need that because I can't always carry my computer around to manage my server. I tested some few apps, even IFTTT to automate some stuff, but you can't achieve anything groundbreaking with that.</p>
<p>Lately, I've been working on a project to automate lots of stuff on a continent wide scale... My programs sometimes fail, sometimes they work well but I need to supervise them. They are not even 6 months old.</p>
<p>So in order to stay in touch with my beloved servers, I coded this bot to control any machine remotely, using whatsapp - cron jobs didn't do the job anymore.</p>
<p>Why Whatsapp? Because I always have my phone with me.</p>
<p>I present to you, my Whatsapp command line remote control utility. Or whatsappcli. It works like a Slack bot, but it allows you way more than a simple slack bot.</p>
<p>You can use it to execute some predefined python functions or to execute commands on a shell, as if you were in front of your computer:</p>
<p>Here it is executing a simple ls:

<p>Or here it is to get the memory usage of my mac:

<p>It can also send simple images (think of a screenshot or anything image related) and tell jokes (Google TTS powered):

<p>For those Defcon people, it can be used as a dead man's switch, as in "delete all porn".</p>
<p>You can find the code here <a href="https://github.com/KarimJedda/whatsappcli">https://github.com/KarimJedda/whatsappcli</a>, it's barebones and you can adapt it to your specific needs. (It's adapted on another programmers code)
In order to do that, you should only edit the routes.py file.</p>
<p>There is 0 security at the moment, because I would don't know where to begin or what to look for.</p>
<p>Telegram can also be used, but I don't need that app. yet.</p>
<p>Have fun with it.</p>
