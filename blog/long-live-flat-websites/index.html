	    <h1>Long live flat websites</h1>
	  

	  <p>I recently cancelled my server subscription because I was running into a lot of troubles managing all the applications and processes that were running.&nbsp;</p><p>Installing Docker for example didn't work out as expected. It was also a huge struggle to install <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, so I decided to move on and <b>do my own thing</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the new thing! I am using a <a href="https://github.com/lektor/lektor">new tool called Lektor</a> developed by <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko">Armin Ronacher</a>&nbsp;to generate Static websites. Why didn't I use Jekyll? Pelican? Hugo? Whatever?&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know, this looked easy and flexible enough to fit my needs and <b>I really don't regret my choice</b> so far.&nbsp;</p><p>This tool is installed on my local machine and I use it to write the new version of my blog. The design is heavily inspired by <a href="https://weblog.sh">weblog.sh</a>&nbsp;in its simplicity and minimalistic design.&nbsp;</p><... added a small text editor that consists of a small html file and some javascript to write my content as I want it, you can find the <a href="/editor">editor here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently it is also easy to add disqus, so that's a good thing because I wouldn't have to handle all the commenting section and stuff.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://dreamatico.com/data_images/banana/banana-5.jpg"></p><p>So that's it, I really love the new design and I hope it will make me post more often.</p><p>I guess I will no longer struggle with:</p><pre>--forever<br>node.js<br>npm<br>build gulp java foo bar<br>handle .md files</pre><p>I just write my content and I MOVE ON.&nbsp;</p><p>I tried contributing to lektor and make this editor available but when I saw that there was some REACT.JS involved I decided not to act because I wasn't ready to install thousands of builders and scaffolders just to run some sample code.&nbsp;</p><p>Long live Python, it does the job for me and keeps my sanity intact.</p>
