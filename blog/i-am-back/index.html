	    <h1>I am back</h1>
	  

	  <p><p>Alright it's been a while since I wrote something, but now I can proudly say that I am &nbsp;back (^▽^)</p><p>For those who know me, these past months have been quite rough, for the others, well, now you know. Special shoutout to the guy on twitter who asked me every week if my new article was online. My first real online fan. Haha! ヽ(゜∇゜)ノ</p><p>Anyways, I was working on a research about "datamining a new series to watch", and part 2 is ready. I was thinking about making a video (pewdiepie style) with voiceover and special effects to become the new youtube star and hopefully meet DJ Khaled. But, I remember a nice article I read, where the guy said that he would "always bet on text", <a href="http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/193447.html">here's the link if you want to have a look</a>.</p><p>So yeah, text is cool. <b>And I'm investing baby!</b><br></p><p>What I'll do in the future is make some videos to explain in depth how to reproduce some steps or some cool stuff I find.</p><p>A little word about motivation though, I was meanwhile programming on heaps of projects, and one of them deals exactly about that: Motivating myself. ( 　ﾟ,_ゝﾟ)</p><p>I watched heaps and heaps of motivational videos with sad music and stuff, and also ones with some good looking people saying relatively sensed stuff. But none of that applied to me. I don't like theory and being passive.</p><p>I like writing and programming and it keeps me kind of sane, so yeah, I wrote a bot that sends 10 euros to my ex if I don't write at least 1 article per week. How did I do it? It's easy, this Blog is hosted on Github Pages, and I use Lektor (a simple CMS made by the guy who created Flask). So, there's a little script on one of my servers, that polls the Github repo weekly, and if there's no article... Bam. ●_●</p><p>My friends told me it's not healthy and several psychiatrist would probably agree and say the same. But those where the same who said a relationship would be a good thing.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Haha, joke's on you. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</i></p><p><br></p><p>Bottomline: If you want to get motivated, find something that's bad for you (eg Loss of Money &amp; possible humiliation) and impose it to yourself with external pressure. I call this "forced darwinism" (yeah, I like pleonasms).</p><p><br></p><p><b>Provoke your evolution, don't wait for it to happen. ಠ_ಠ</b></p><p><br></p><p><i>Disclaimer: I'm not saying get bankrupt or drop out of school or something, just, if you really want something, feeling the guilt of not having it will wake you up 10 times faster than any motivational crap with epic music and fabricated manipulation to advertise T-shirts and motivational posters, with the sole purpose :3 to sell your delicious cookies to major alprazolam producers.</i></p><div><br></div></p>
